(Insert project description here)

## Building and installing

Make sure you have installed Node.js (v12) and Python (v3) on your computer. Run `npm install` to build all necessary dependencies for overall project. `cd frontend` and run `npm install` to install those for the frontend. `cd backend` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install those for the backend. Note that you can do so globally, but you can also use the venv I set up as well. Just be careful since it only applies for Windows. If anyone doesn't have Windows, message me, so we can add another venv.

Run `git checkout dev` so that you're working on the developer branch. From there, you can checkout to feature branch you're currently working on

Run `npm run start:dev` to start the local servers for both frontend and backend to begin development!

If you only need to work on the backend, just run `npm run start:backend`. If you only need to work on the frontend, just run `npm run start:frontend`.
